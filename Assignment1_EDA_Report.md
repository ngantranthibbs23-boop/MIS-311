# Assignment 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 1. Data Overview

The dataset was provided by the instructor for this assignment. It contains employee information, including age, gender, department, salary, joining date, performance score, work experience, employment status, location, and session.

The original dataset contains 203 records and 12 columns. It is used to explore employee characteristics, salary distribution, and workforce information.

## 2. Data Cleaning

The original dataset contained 203 records. After checking for duplicate rows, 4 duplicates were removed, leaving 199 records.

The Performance Score column contained 105 missing values, representing 52.8% of the cleaned dataset. These missing values were retained because there was not enough information to determine the actual performance scores. Filling them with the mean or median could affect the accuracy of the analysis.

Therefore, calculations involving Performance Score were based only on the 94 available values.

## 3. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics were calculated for four numerical variables: Age, Salary, Performance Score, and Experience.

| Variable | Count | Mean | Median | Minimum | Maximum |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Age | 199 | 39.40 | 37 | 18 | 65 |
| Salary | 199 | 5,621.85 | 5,432 | 2,025 | 9,973 |
| Performance Score | 94 | 2.96 | 3 | 1 | 5 |
| Experience | 199 | 10.14 | 10 | 1 | 20 |

## 4. Key Insights

### Insight 1: Average Salary by Department

The IT department has the highest average salary at 5,838.17, followed by HR at 5,556.81. Sales has the lowest average salary at 5,476.44. However, the differences between departments are relatively small, suggesting that average salaries are fairly similar across the three departments.

### Insight 2: Employee Status Distribution

The dataset contains 101 inactive employees (50.75%) and 98 active employees (49.25%). The difference is very small, indicating that the number of active and inactive employees is almost evenly distributed. This finding provides an overview of the workforce status in the organization.
